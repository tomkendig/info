<h2>The 2008 Kendig gathering and picnic will be held on Sunday the 13th
of July in the
High Pavilion at East Lampeter Community Park just east of Lancaster
Pennsylvania. Complete details of this event including maps, schedule
and venue can be found at <a href="http://www.gathering.kendig.info">www.gathering.kendig.info</a>.</h2>
<h2>Planning continues for a Kendig gathering for the 300th anniversary
of Martin
Kendig's arrival in North America. This Kendig gathering will be in
2010 in Lancaster Pennsylvania.</h2>
<h2>Gatherings are for people that share a common name but might not be
related to each other. Reunions normally involve a single common
ancestor.</h2>

<h2>Kendig genealogy is part of the information shared here and at the
Kendig gatherings. Many people independently gather genealogy
information. This is an attempt to consolidate as much of this Kendig
genealogy information as possible. Peter Kundig and his descendants
genealogy can be found at <a href="http://www.genealogy.kendig.info">www.genealogy.kendig.info</a>.</h2>
