   <title>Kendig 2000 Annual Review</title>
</head>
<body>
Holiday Greeting at year 2001 end from Tom K,
<p>As the holiday season approaches (and passes by), my thoughts turn to
friends and family. For some this will be the only communication of the
year. I'd like to thank those that send a holiday letter so I can learn
some about them. I only wish my annual letters are half as entertaining
as some I've gotten.
<p>My web page is a little out of date. I have not placed any genealogical
information there since the reunion. I am about to do a major update with
lots of new names, information, references and locations. I should at least
double the number entries in the GedCom data base. I'll leave the genealogy
people know by email when this event occurs. Again a reminder to those
of you who have not updated your email address book, my preferred email
address is&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
When you receive email from me, my return address and trailer will show
kendig1@kendig.net which is my throw away address. As soon as I get spammed
at that email address, I will change it. All friends should mark in their
address book <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
Generally, never give out to someone else this email address - which will
increase it's chance of being spammed.&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@credence.com">tom_kendig@credence.com</a></u>
is my work email address - so my home and work email name presently match.
<p>I wish you and each person dear to you the best in the next year. I
like visitors - so come and visit if you can, email when it is convenient,
write if you can't visit or do email. God bless!
<p>Happy Holidays all!
<p>Tom K
