   <title>Kendig 2000 Annual Review</title>
</head>
<body>
Holiday Greeting at year 2000 end from Tom K,
<p>As the holiday season approaches (and passes by), my thoughts turn to
friends and family. For some this will be the only communication of the
year. I'd like to thank those that send a holiday letter so I can learn
some about them. I only wish my annual letters are half as entertaining
as some I've gotten.
<p>The highlight of the year was the Y2K Kendig reunion - that my web page
at www.kendig.net has been dedicated to for some time. The weather that
day was idyllic, the attendance good, the food better than ever. If you
are interested, you can read more about the details on my web page. But
for me it was a very good experience and the fulfillment of a dream to
see Kendigs that I never got visit with in my youth. My aunt Toots and
uncle Ray and both my parents spent loads of time to set this up. I hope
there is another, but none has the specialness of the first.
<p>The reunion in the middle of summer was a good reason to see the Canada
and the USA. I took a four week driver across the country with my son Martin
and a old high school friend of mine Paul Madeira. The trip also meet all
my goals. My son, Paul and I got to see three bears, elk, mountain sheep,
mountain goats, eagles and the most beautiful country there is. Originally
I had planned on heading out of the Bay Area to the east and head toward
Dinosaur and Yellowstone. Well on the way to the bank in Fremont (final
cash withdrawal for the trip), Paul mentioned he really did not want to
see Yellowstone but would like to see the Redwoods and Rainier. So I told
him to plot a course and when I got back from the machine - we went north
instead of East - how is that for a last minute decision. It worked out
wonderfully. The camp site at Mt Rainier and Mt Robson in Canada where
idyllic (was that the second time I used that word to describe something
during the year?). There were more adventures than I can relate here -
but all worked well. Saw my cousin Chris in Botzman, saw my dear friends
the Bartos in Chicago, from&nbsp; where Paul flew back to Florida, went
white water rafting with my good friends the Elms in Pittsburgh - after
a night with Harry in a pub in Squirrel Hill (where I used to live in Pittsburgh)
and found Kendig genealogy information in Colorado at High School friends
the Silars. Somehow the reunion happened in the middle of all of this.
<p>There was another great event this year - Credence has an annual remote
sales meeting. In February the sales meeting - that was supposed to be
held last December - was moved to Hawaii. I reluctantly went for a week
(seriously I don't enjoy Hawaii) and managed to pick as my activity for
the trip deep sea fishing, my first time, and did catch fish - Mai Mai
or dolphin fish. Well this years annual remote sales meeting was held in
--- Whistler Canada. Well the Whistler location - and a paid trip there
- was a dream come true for me. For my activity this year I choose snow
boarding - my first time - I need more practice here. But after five days
of continuous meetings - I skied for three strait days with my brother,
his kids and their friends - and oh yes Dan Wirth - the best skier I know
who meet me there. Now there was no new snow when I arrived on Sunday -
but on Thursday it started snowing - and snow it did. The skiing was -
well idyllic (opps). My nephew Andres thinks he is a better snow boarder
that Dan skier. Andres is easily the best ski/board person in the Kendig
family. I can barely keep up - but man - with conditions and the company
- it was a blast. The hotel was next to the lift. At the end of the day
of skiing one could take off your skies, walk down the steps and into the
hotel basement to check your skies. The one day there was so much new snow
at the end of the day that when I looked down the steps - they were covered
with fresh new snow - so I said - what the heck - and skied down the steps
and then took off my skies. It was wonderful.
<p>I have one other fond memory of the year. I made several trips to the
wine country during the year. This is my favorite thing to do with out
of town guests (so come on out whenever any of you want) - ask Paul Madeira
- that's how we started his vacation -sipping champaign. Well some of us
at work decided to head that way on Super bowl Sunday. It was raining in
Fremont during the early morning start. So when the parties involved got
to the wine country - we found there was a wonderful sunny sky! In addition
there was almost NO people in the Sonoma Valley where we went. Near the
end of the day - during the Super bowl - we were in Kenwood winery - one
of my personal favorites - and we had the entire tasting counter to ourselves.
I have never been to Kenwood when there was nothing but elbow pushing to
even get to a spot at the counter. It was - well idyllic! The group got
upset with me because I refused to leave - I just wanted to stand there
and enjoy the moment. Never again - well except for this next Super bowl.
Any takers?
<p>My internet connection remains - Cable Modem! Such a deal. Listening
to internet radio (check out <a href="www.fmbayarea.com">www.fmbayarea.com</a>
or <a href="www.klove.com">www.klove.com</a>). In the beginning of the
year I used to follow my investments, then the end of the year happened
and I try to ignore investments now. Of course the cable modem is a great
way to download mp3 files from Napster for the Nomad MP3 player.
<p>The fall season brings another activity for me. Now how do I get in
shape for skiing anyway? I referee soccer! I'm secretary of the local referee
association. I do a lot of games. I upgraded my license this year to the
next level. I have a ton of referee stories. But I think I do a pretty
good job and I do it because I want the kids to have a fair game so they
can have a good time playing. Refereeing soccer is like skiing - there
is always someone better than you and some worse than you! I have a couple
of relatives that are better soccer referees than I.
<p>My web page is a little out of date. I have not placed any genealogical
information there since the reunion. I am about to do a major update with
lots of new names, information, references and locations. I should at least
double the number entries in the GedCom data base. I'll leave the genealogy
people know by email when this event occurs. Again a reminder to those
of you who have not updated your email address book, my preferred email
address is&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
When you receive email from me, my return address and trailer will show
kendig1@kendig.net which is my throw away address. As soon as I get spammed
at that email address, I will change it. All friends should mark in their
address book <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
Generally, never give out to someone else this email address - which will
increase it's chance of being spammed.&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@credence.com">tom_kendig@credence.com</a></u>
is my work email address - so my home and work email name presently match.
<p>I wish you and each person dear to you the best in the next year. I
like visitors - so come and visit if you can, email when it is convenient,
write if you can't visit or do email. God bless!
<p>Happy Holidays all!
<p>Tom K
