   <title>Kendig 1999 Annual Review</title>
</head>
<body>
Post Y2K Holiday Greeting from the Kendigs,
<p>I got behind this year so this year in review is late. But, what is
the adage - better late than never. Part of the demotivating factor in
getting this letter together is I'm back with court dates and appearances
which will continue into next year - so I don't feel good about that -
but with that comment out of the way - on to better things.
<p>1999 started off in Reno at the end of a Holiday skiing trip to Utah
with my boys and ended at a New Years eve party in San Jose. 1999 was also
the year the Carvan I've been driving for 13 years died a miserable death.
It was the steam coming from the dip stick hole that was the dead giveway.
So now I drive a new Mazda MPV for another 13 years?
<p>The boys both participated in baseball this year. In the fall, Dillon
was on the Freshman football team (by the end of the season he was one
of several wide receivers). Martin played fall baseball. Martin has now
moved to the larger baseball field - and can lead for stealing bases. I
continue to do soccer refereeing. By the end of the soccer season I was
able to referee five soccer games on a Saturday, some as center, some as
an assistant. It is my way of keeping in shape. This year the Fremont Soccer
Referee Association nominated me the secretary of the organization giving
me some other responsibilities. I've been told Tara has a boyfriend which
I believe is her activity.
<p>I basically had two vacations this last year. One with the boys, the
other a business trip to Taiwan. The trip to Taiwan was short, meant to
support a few key customers there and train the representatives there to
use the software I have written. It was my introduction to asian culture.
I feel much more comfortable with trips to Europe than to Asia. A friend
summed up Taiwan this way - it is the land of pickled eggs, motor scooters
and barber shops. Ask if you don't understand the metaphors, you can always
email me for an explanation.
<p>The trip with the boys during the summer was to Arizona. We hiked about
half way down the Bright Angle Trail at the north end of the Grand Canyon.
This hike shows some of the trials I have to solve. The boys are young
and in good enough shape to make the trip to the bottom of the canyon and
back no problem - but they lack the motivation to do so. I have the motivation
to due so - but as time goes on I'm starting to loose the stamina that
allowed me to make the trip to the bottom of the canyon and out in the
same day some 20 years ago. The other highlight of the trip was a day spent
hiking in Zion Canyon. It was a wonderful trip hiking up the narrow canyon.
They boys remember this trip by the pool they played and the swimming in
the pool at my friend Wirthless's house. At the end of 1999 we took another
trip to Arizona and did some rock climbing with Wirthless. The boys asked
me why I had not told them before that Wirthless was an expert rock climber
- I replied I knew they were older now and perhaps more interested.
<p>I was pleased to entertain several out of town guest, including, from
college days, Harry Levinson and Joe Elm and Mike and Anne Milicia (Anne
found one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city - I love going there
Anne). From High School days, Tom Barto and Dan Wirth. A missed visit from
Howard Kaplan was a disappointment - maybe next year Howard? My parents
visited during the summer to see their grand kids. Dad made a separate
trip at the end of the summer on his own. When my brother Dave came out
for a visit we drove to see my other brother Doug in Oregon with my boys.
Dave and my boys and I hiked hiked up to the top of Lassen Peak on that
trip.
<p>In this time of the internet, I've focused some of my time on this media
also. Fremont has one of the premier internet services in the world, based
on a cable modem (the same cable used for the TV signals) which, as a birthday
present for my son and I, I've now purchased. Cable modems put 56K modems
and DSL to shame with a download speed of about 1000 times the 56K modem
rate and 10 times faster than DSL. This is the internet the way it should
be, and I'm spoiled now (just as the ad says). As I surf the net for Kendig
information, I simultaneously listen to net radio on my stereo now and
have a large and international station list to choose from. In addition
I have purchased the rights to kendig.net and it will now be my internet
address for as long as I keep paying the bill for the registration. This
internet address is of course much easier to remember as a web page location
and email address than my previous location which people other than I had
a difficult time remembering. My old email address and web page will eventually
go away - so please update your email address book and delete the old web
address and replace it by <u><a href="http://www.kendig.net">www.kendig.net</a></u>.
My preferred email address is&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
When you receive email from me, my return address and trailer will show
kendig1@kendig.net which is my through away address. As soon as I get spammed
at that email address, I will change it. All friends should mark in their
address book <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@kendig.net">tom_kendig@kendig.net</a></u>.
Generally, never give out to someone else, this email address which will
increase it's chance of being spammed.&nbsp; <u><a href="mailto:tom_kendig@credence.com">tom_kendig@credence.com</a></u>
is my work email address - so my home and work email name presently match.
<p>The web page at <u><a href="http://www.kendig.net">www.kendig.net</a></u>
is the start of new information. Much of this year I have spent working
to provide more information and to provide better presentation of the kendig
genealogy. Through the year I've chosen the freeware program "Family Origins"
from the Mormons to place the data I have in a format that allows me to
produce GedCom files and generate html format for a web page. This information
can be found at kendig.net for any who are interested or would like to
review the genealogy.
<p>The web page information is all forward looking to the events of the
summer of 2000 which wil,l for me, include an extended Kendig reunion in
Lancaster. When the exact date is chosen I will post this information on
my web page. This will be the first chance for many of us to see my brother
David and Wanda's new twin girls.
<p>We all wish you and each person dear to you the best in the next year.
We like visitors - so come and visit if you can, email when it is convenient,
write if you can't visit or do email. God bless!
<p>Happy Holidays all!
<p>Tom, Tara, Dillon &amp; Dustin Martin
