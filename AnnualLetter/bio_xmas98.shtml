<body>
&nbsp;Holiday Greeting from the Kendigs,
<p>Was it a good year or bad? Well some of both and in the end, a lot to
be thankful for. This will be the first year I'm writing in HTML, just
my way of being in the late 90's - and in making use of a PC. I've been
in the Amiga and Sun computer world for years. This year I entered the
PC world. I now have full time access to a laptop which I've gotten to
take on the road on several occasions over the last year.
<p>Grandpa Kendig (my dad) helped have the boys and I travel to PA for
Thanksgiving. We had a wonderful week in PA and Baltimore. Three memorable
meals (spaghetti, Thanksgiving and crab), a chance to see all the relatives
and the best weather I've ever had on the Mall in Washington. Both of my
boys enjoyed the National Gallery of Art - which amazed me. My favorite
story is the night that I showed the internet to my Amish neighbor Amos,
his son and grandson. These Amish were interested to "see" and understand
just a little about what they had read so much about and been told by their
church not to become involved in. On to a more organized view.
<p>WORK - It turns out the beginning of 1998 showed record sales for Credence
into Asia. There was a lavish sales meeting in San Diego. But we all know
where that ends - Asia buys nothing presently. There were layoffs in October
and forced shutdowns at the years end. The CEO of Credence did not survive.
The new year will be scrappy. My work is figuring out how to have Credence
Test Equipment interface to production handlers and probers and be production
worthy. At one point during the summer there was a big contract on the
line. Credence testers had to work with a certain prober in Taiwan or Credence
did not get paid. They asked me to pack for Taiwan - but I convinced them
that I could work here in Fremont. They would work in Taiwan during their
day collecting data for me to analyze during my day and I would make changes
so Taiwan would have new software in their morning (delivered by internet)
in Taiwan. My boss accepted the proposal and it worked beautifully.
<p>KIDS - Martin cracked (broke) his wrist the day of the baseball team
initial parents meeting. He recovered fine after six weeks in a (soft)
cast. Martin does well in school, particularly in math. He is very close
to the top of his honors math class. At seventh grade I only hope he can
keep up the pace he has established. Dillon struggles in school and in
eighth grade has not yet developed a particular area of interest. Dillon
did get to spend over two weeks back in PA on his own. Dillon thrived during
the trip playing with his cousins and having a grand time at the shore,
in Washington D.C. and at Hershey Park. The boys tell me Tara has her driving
permit. I see Tara at most for eight hours the first Sunday of each month.
<p>COURT - First year since 1991 that I have been not been served papers.
<p>SPORTS - This year my sports first. I spent this fall refereeing the
Fremont soccer club games. I got several unsolicited compliments - and
at the end of the season was recognized for my "Valuable Contribution to
Fremont Youth Soccer" at the final referee meeting of the season. I had
generally a good year doing it - including an under 16 girls championship
game that went to shots from the penalty mark through 20 players (10 from
each side). I was asked to do High School games - which I've now started
doing and it is fun also. Dillon participated for a second year in football.
Both Dillon and Martin were on baseball teams in the spring. I was on the
baseball sidelines this year. The boys did not have as much fun this year
playing baseball - both spent more time on the bench than in other seasons.
Neither had coaches that helped them or the other people on the teams become
better ball players.
<p>ADVENTURES - Several this year. The highlight was a two week trip to
Arizona and New Mexico with the boys. We got to see Carlsbad Caverns and
Roswell and hear stories about Dan Wirth's adventures in the desert. I
went to two boarder towns with the boys. Nogales and Douglas were both
dirty towns. Walking around in Nogales for a day made the boys appreciate
being in America. That was not my intent, but they did not like the solicitation
and poverty. We also went to Tombstone and the Queen Copper mine tour.
It was a good trip. The trip started out with the night camping under the
stars in the desert - when I had an insect crawl in my ear during the night.
Just another story from the trip. I mentioned earlier the trip for Thanksgiving
on the east coast. The last adventure for the year with the kids will be
some skiing over the holidays, possibly in Utah.
<p>I had my own separate adventures this year. Weekends in LA and the wine
country were the west coast sort of thing to do. I planned a special trip
to Arizona with High School friend Don Dippner. Dippner had never been
on a plan before and only west of Pittsburgh once in his life. I have this
vivid picture in my mind of him getting off the airplane in Phoenix. He
looked like he was lucky to survive the flight. When I heard the flight
was delayed I was sure it was because they had to make an emergency landing
to deal with Don. The whole trip with friend Wirthless driving was one
event after another. The Grand Canyon, watching the England vs Italy world
cup game in Las Vegas - although not the final it was one of the best played
games in the championship, camping under the stars in the desert of California,
hanging out on a beach in San Diego - playing pinochle all the while. We
might do it again sometime, but only if Don is willing :-).
<p>VISITORS - Harry Levinson visited early in the year for a trip to the
wine country. Mom and Dad visited during the early summer. Joe Elm stopped
by during a business and then a nice trip to the wine country.
<p>ACTIVITIES - I've been spending more time on the net this year, now
that I have Netscape access at home. My WEB page genealogy has been updated
with lots of new information and additional people. I particularly like
the perpetual calendar. The site history file will let you know what changes
I have made since the last time you might have checked. The boys use the
net some for school. Martin uses it to play an online game Diablo. The
boys each have their own email address - <a href="mailto: tkendig@concentric.net">dillon_kendig@hotmail.com</a>
and <a href="mailto: tkendig@concentric.net">dmkendig@usa.net</a> - they
check them infrequently. I'd like them to develop their own home page but
that is too much like work. I use ICQ and AOL instant messenger to talk
with friends a relatives on the net also. This is our fifth year and fourth
annual letter on the net. You can always send email to me at <a href="mailto: tkendig@concentric.net">tkendig@concentric.net</a>
and I encourage you to check out my home page at <a href="http://www.cris.com/~tkendig">http://www.cris.com/~tkendig</a>.
You can send me email from the home page also.
<p>We all wish you and each person dear to you the best in the next year.
We like visitors - so come and visit if you can, email when it is convenient,
write if you can't.
<p>Happy Holidays all!
<p>Tom, Tara, Dillon &amp; Dustin Martin
