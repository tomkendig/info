<h2>The 2010 Kendig gathering and picnic will be held on Sunday the
18th
of July in the
High Pavilion at East Lampeter Community Park just east of Lancaster
Pennsylvania. Complete details of this event including maps, schedule
and venue can be found at <a href="http://www.gathering.kendig.info">www.gathering.kendig.info</a>.</h2>
<h2>This year marks the 300th anniversary of Martin
Kendig's arrival in North America. This Kendig gathering is scheduled
the day after the public celebration of this arrival at <a
 href="http://www.lancasterroots300.org">Lancaster County Roots 300</a>
on the 17 of July at <a href="http://www.hansherr.org">Hans Herr House</a>
in Willow Street. </h2>
<h2>Gatherings are for people that share a common name but might not be
related to each other. Reunions normally involve a single common
ancestor. This will be a Kendig Gathering for anyone that considers
themselves an ancestor of Martin Kendig and a Kendig reunion for
descendants of Earl and Mary Kendig of Ronks.</h2>
<h2>The Kendig Gathering event organization is handled through the <a
 href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/KendigGathering">Kendig Gathering</a>
Yahoo group where you can see photos from previous years and find
useful links. You may have to join the yahoo group to send email to the
group.

<h2>Kendig genealogy is part of the information shared here and at the
Kendig gatherings. Many people independently gather genealogy
information. This is an attempt to consolidate as much of this Kendig
genealogy information as possible. Peter Kundig and his descendants
genealogy can be found at <a href="http://www.genealogy.kendig.info">www.genealogy.kendig.info</a>.</h2>
