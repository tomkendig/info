<hr>Welcome to the Kendig Genealogy Home
Page!
Pick a family point of interest from the list below.
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="kendigall/index.htm">The Kendig Genealogy project.</a>
This is
all the Kendigs, including Kendig names not linked and all their
decedents.
This is the BIG GedCom.</li>
  <li> <a href="kundigpet/index.htm">The Peter Kundig Genealogy report.</a>
This
is as far back as I can trace the Kendigs and all Peter's decedents.</li>
  <li> <a href="kendigosc/index.htm">The Oscar Landis Kendig
Genealogical
report</a> A more recent Kendig branch maintained by Tom Kendig branch.</li>
  <li> <a href="kendigear/index.htm">The Earl Oscar Kendig
Genealogical
report</a>
Tom Kendig's grandfather branch.</li>
  <li> <a href="kendigdan/index.htm">The Daniel Landis Kendig
Genealogical
report</a>
This is as prepared by Todd Sheldon Kendig, Tom Kendig's second cousin,
one time
removed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>This site recommends using <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/">Family
Search</a> to
record
Genealogy work. There are several reasons for this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The program is free. You can download it <a
 href="http://www.familysearch.org/">here</a>
(use the left side of the page with the text labeled "order family
history
resources") after giving them your email and post office address.</li>
  <li>Unlike other free ware programs, it has the backing of all the
genealogy
people in Salt Lake City Utah who probably won't go out of business
soon
or be swallowed by someone else.</li>
  <li>It does the job with support for the following (which of course
are
features
I use) - Gedcoms, web page creation protecting the living, merging
Gedcom
files, consistency reports.</li>
</ul>
To be fair, these are the shortcomings of this program:
<ul>
  <li>Family Search does not run on a Mac or Unix based systems.</li>
  <li>The merge feature, although adequate, could be improved.</li>
  <li>Some fields for each person are Later Day Saints relevant only
- such
as
the Christening date - which I either ignore - or in this case use it
as
the Baptism date.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the web page it creates has missing labels which
cause links
not to work. I assume as time goes on, these will be fixed.</li>
</ul>
