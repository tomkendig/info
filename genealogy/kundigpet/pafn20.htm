<blockquote><p>     Daniel Kendig was born in Lampeter Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 19 July 1760 the only son of Henry Kendig and Anna Groff.  He had five sisters: Susan, who married John Groff; Elizabeth, who married Martin Eshleman; Nancy, who married John Forrer; Barbara, who married Benjamin Groff and Kittie, who married Martin Forrer.<br>
     Daniel married Anna Forrer the daughter of John Forrer and Elizabeth Mylin on 1 Oct 1782.  He died 25 Nov 1809 in Lancaster County.<br>
     After Daniel's death, Anna married Tobias Crider and in the early 1800's moved to Montgomery County, Ohio with at least five of her children.  It is believed that her second husband died before 1850 because in that year we find her living in Wayne Township of Montgomery County with her daughter Ann.  She died 30 January 1852 and is buried in Bath Cemetery, which is located in Greene County, Ohio very close to the Montgomery County line.</p>
