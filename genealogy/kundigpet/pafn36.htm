<blockquote><p>1860 Elkhart Co., IN census 1870 Elkhart Co., IN census Came to Elkhart County, In. 1859</p>
<p>Obit of Francis Peoples  18 Apr 1891<br>
     Francis Peoples, one of the old settlers of this county, died in Jackson Township, Elkhart County, April 17, 1891, age 77 years, 4 months, and 8 days.  He was born in Lancaster County, PA., Dec. 9, 1813, and was married to Miss Mary Kindig, of Montgomery County, Ohio.  Seven children were born to them, four sons and three daughters, one of whom a daughter, preceded the father across the river; the rest, with the aged companion surviving to mourn their loss.<br>
     The funeral services were held at the Baintertown church on Sunday afternoon.  There were 122 teams at the funeral.<br>
     Thus one by one our old settlers bid adieu to scenes of life and labor, and go where there are no more toil and tears, no night of death.<br>
     The chair that held his feeble frame<br>
     The dreaded winter through,<br>
     Is vacant now, there's no one here<br>
     To fill his place, 'tis true<br>
                    Mrs. Edna Peoples</p>
<p>     His son Francis, father of Mrs. Juday, was born in Lancaster county., Penn., December 9, 1813. and like most of his ancestors before him was a farmer.  He went to Ohio when a young man, or in 1835, and married Miss Mary Kindig, who was also a native of Lancaster county, Penn., born March 11, 1816, and the daughter of Henry and Madaline (Leslie) Kindig, both of whom were originally from Lancaster county, Penn., but early settlers of Montgomery county, Ohio.  To Mr. And Mrs. Peoples were born seven children:  Henry, Sarah A., Selina (died in infancy), William E., John F., Ann M. and Aldia A., all natives of Montgomery county, Ohio.  In 1859 Mr. Peoples came to Indiana and settled on the farm where his widow now resided.   There his death occurred April 17, 1891.  He was a worthy and honored citizen.  Both Mr. And Mrs. Peoples were baptized in the German Baptist Church August 17, 1862.  Mrs. Peoples is still living and is quite advanced in years.<br>
