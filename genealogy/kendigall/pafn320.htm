<blockquote><p>  Settled on the farm owned at some point by Dr. & Mrs. James H. Gault.  That farm was in the Hess family c.1766 to 1936.  A Hess cemetery is located just outside the village of Conestoga along Sickman's Mill Road on the southern hill of the farm where there are 50 graves, including third generation Hess's: David Hess and Wife and Ann Keeport.  The Gault farmhouse was built 1850 by David and Magdalena Hess.</p>

<blockquote><p><br>
  Ordained bishop in the Kraybill district of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference.  A United Zion/Union Church was erected on the corner of his farm in Donegal Township (later West Donegal), PA.  Mt. Hope Cemetery, in which Samuel and some of his progeny are buried lies across the road from the church.  Records of the cemetery do not record Samuel's burial, and no stone has been found, but Joseph Hess (Sixth generation) reports that his father and he searched the site where they believe there ancestor was buried.</p>
<p>  He purchased 280 acres of land in York and Cumberland counties in 1811 from Jacob Witmer, paying well over 4700 pounds.  At the time of his death, Samuel was wealthy and left his estate in a convoluted will which required forty years to settle.</p>

<blockquote><p>  The Jacob L. Hess family lived on the farm in Pequea Township that his father had lived on.  It had been bought by Grandfather Michael Hess (1757-1820) from the Heagy Estate on August 6, 1781, and consists of 107.3 acres.  At the present time the farm is being farmed by a lineal descendant, Henry Herr, grandson of Henry H. Hess, (July 3, 1860  -  Sept. 4, 1962).  At present (1993) that farm has been in the family for 212 years.<p>  Jacob L. Hess was meticulous with his accounts.  He recorded every transaction, including every penny, every ounce. every minute men worked, and it 'paid off.'  He left a good sized estate to be divided among his heirs.<p>  Here are some of the products that grew in his fields: Tobacco, wheat, clover, corn, timothy, rye and oats; also sweet potatoes, cabbage, celery and grapes.  Some of the products sold, (1859): Lard - 10 cents per pound, butter - 18 cents per pound, apples and cider, apple butter, apples - one barrel - $2.00.</blockquote>

<p><a href="pafg320.htm#10388" name="10388"><b>Rev. Abraham Z. Hess</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  Abraham was an ordained  minister in the River Brethren Church.</p>
<p>  The use of the "Z" in Abraham's name cannot easily be explained.  C. Hess Haagen reports that he has legal documents on which his signature is Abraham Z. Hess.  Hess observed that Michael Hess and Conrad Ziegler of East Donegal were both ordained ministers in the River Brethren Church and that they married Schock sisters.  Could the "Z" thus stand for Ziegler?  However there is no evidence of reciprocity in giving a Ziegler child the middle name of Hess. Hess says that the answer to the riddle is not simple.</p>

<p><a href="pafg320.htm#10397" name="10397"><b>Abram Musser Hess</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  Elected to the office of Deacon in the Manor - Pequea District of the River Brethren Church in 1863 and served in this capacity until his death in 1907.  His sons, Abraham Zeigler, Noah Zeigler, and Enos Herr Hess all were ordained ministers in the Church at the time what it was beginning to be called the Brethren in Christ Church rather than by the earlier designations of Dunkard or River Brethren.<p>  C. Hess Haagen adds: "It would appear that in addition to being a very successful farmer, Abram Musser Hess was a builder.  In 1863, he and his wife Ann constructed the great barn that is still in use of the homestead farm that Michael Hess purchased in 1754.  Year after year he built tobacco sheds, a building of pigs (too large and complex to be called a pen or sty), an ice house and many other structures at the home farm as well as at the farms that he owned in Quarryville. In 1887 - 1888 he build a retirement home and barn on Church road and in subsequent years added a number of out-buildings.  In 1890, he supervised the construction of the Pequea BIC Meeting House, ordering materials, serving as a  "gofor," providing food and lodging for workmen when this was necessary, and throughout the project working as whatever job that needed an extra hand. As Church Treasurer he also served as "paymaster" to the several contractors and paid for materials; freight car loads of lumber down to hinges and nails and paint."</blockquote>

<blockquote><p><br>
  First Hess generation to move to York and Cumberland Counties. He and Elizabeth moved from Lancaster County to Fairview Township, York County on land lying along the southern edge of the Yellow Breeches Creek.  Some of the land purchased by his father, Samuel Hess, lay across the creek in Cumberland County.  Constructed of logs, the original farmhouse stood in the front yard of the present stone house. It was torn down after the new stone house was completed at a cost of $1,300 dollars in 1853.  Two years later, Christian Hess bought land lying along the Lisburn road and had a large brick house constructed between Milltown Road and the point where Lisburn Road makes a 90 degree turn toward the PA. Industrial School.  This house was built for his daughter Anna and her husband, Martin Zimmerman.  Later they settled in the West and the farm has been owned since by Samuel Hertzler, Frank Hertzler, Nathaniel Hertzler and presently by Hempt Brothers.</p>
<p> He was the executor of the estate of his father and received one-half of the land purchased in York and Cumberland Counties, but was required to pay into the estate an amount equal to the difference between his share of the estate and the value of the land..</p>

<blockquote><p>  First generation born at Hess Homestead in York and Cumberland Counties.<p>  In 1815, Christian Hess, his wife and family moved to the farm adjoining the Slate Hill Church.  At that time, his son, Peter, had married and begun to farm the old Hess farm.  His wife never liked the isolated location.  Grandpa and grandma were married on November 15, 1877 and lived for two or three years as tenants on a farm about two miles east of Peter,  When grandpa became a preacher in 1879, Peter moved to a farm south of Mechanicsburg and grandpa took his father's farm.  In his last illness Christian and grandpa took his farther's farm.  In his last illness, Christian developed edema and passed away on October 30, 1886 at 69 years of age.  He was a large man weighing 345 lbs. and required eight pallbearers.  Grandpa once showed me a pair of his father's large shoes.<p>  Three of the sisters, Catherine (5 years), Rebecca (32 years), and Mary (55 years), died many years before I was born.  Three others, Elizabeth (75), Peter and his twin sister, Esther (both 78 years!) lived as some distance and died in my early childhood.  However "Aunt Barb" used to visit grandpa and grandma frequently as his "last sister."   I knew her as my oldest relative.  I was told that in her prime of life, she made "dried sweet corn" and sold it in the Harrisburg Chestnut Street Farmers Market which stood beside Salem Church.  A more complete account of this product is given in my own story.  Children are sometimes cruel in noting and addressing the defects and peculiarities of others.  Aunt Barb had a voice which sounded as if she needed to "clear her throat" which she did frequently.  A common expression of hers was "Ach!, what was their names?"  Now I have the same problem!  My first experience as a pallbearer was at her funeral as one of her grand nephews.  The other grand nephews who served were Joseph Hess (Peter's only grandson), Marlin Seitz (grandpa's daughter Elizabeth's son), and Noah, Paul and Laban  Zimmerman (Esther's grandsons).</blockquote>
