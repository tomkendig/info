&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;Daun Kendig died at home Wednesday, April 3rd. She is survived by her five-<br>
year-old daughter, Bessana Olivia Kendig, and their beloved dog, Rory; her<br>
parents, Russ and Gladys Kendig of Canton, Ohio; sisters and their spouses:<br>
Diane Kendig and Paul Beauvais of Lynn, MA and Beth and Jim McBride of<br>
Denver, CO; her brother and family: Rusty and Cheryl Kendig and daughters<br>
(Daun's nieces) Lauren and Claire, of Canton, Ohio; and many other loving and<br>
caring friends nationwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;Daun was born in Canton, Ohio and graduated from Perry High School in 1970.<br>
She obtained a B.S. from Ohio University, Athens in 1974 and an MA (1976) and<br>
PhD (1987) from the University of Illinois. She came to St. Cloud in 1982 as a<br>
member of the Department of Communications Studies at St. Cloud State<br>
University, where she directed PLAyers, a student performance group. She was<br>
a member of the National Communication Association (Performance Studies<br>
Division), a supporter of the Humane Society, a member of First United<br>
Methodist Church in St. Cloud, and a sponsor in the Godchild Project between<br>
St. Paul and Guatemala. Her publications included writing on the work of Eudora<br>
Welty and on student performance as a means of service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;The open house and celebration of life which Daun requested will take place at<br>
the home at a later date. Meanwhile, a memorial gathering will be held at First<br>
United Methodist Church on Fifth Avenue this Saturday, 6 April 2002 at 1:00<br>
p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorials be sent to First United<br>
Methodist Church in St. Cloud or the National Marrow Donor Program<br>
(www.marrow.org). Donations to a scholarship fund for her daughter's education<br>
can be sent to Bessana Kendig (Benefit), US Bank, 1015 St. Germain Street, St.<br>
Cloud, MN 56301.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;The family sends special thanks to the members of First United Methodist<br>
Church in St. Cloud, St. Paul's United Methodist Church in Canton, Ohio, the<br>
Department of Communications Studies at SCSU, parents and staff at Children's<br>
Day Montessori, Dr. Nicholas Reuter and staff, the nurses and staff of Fifth Floor<br>
South at St. Cloud Hospital, Dr. Linda Burns and staff of the Bone Marrow<br>
Transplant Clinic and Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, and Daun's neighbors.<br>
While we would have asked for a different journey, we could not have asked for<br>
better fellow travelers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
