<blockquote><p>  An article in the Pennsylvania Mennonite Heritage records: "A Hans Hess was baptized on July 11, 1683, at Wald, Zurich and is believed to be the Anabaptist Hans Hess (died 1733) who migrated to America in 1717."  He was a grandson or great-grandson of Hans Jacob Hess, the blacksmith and Anabaptist minister of Baretswil.</p>
<p>  Hans was among the first Hesses recorded as coming to America. --- In 1717 Hans Hess and his wife, Magdalena, crossed the Atlantic with their six small children (and one on the way!)  In time they raised a total of eleven children in their wilderness home.</p>
<p>  Hans Hess and his wife Magdalena, first settled just west of his fellow countryman, John Kreyte [Kreider], between Mill Creek and the Conestoga River in Lampeter where 100 acres were surveyed and purchased by him on May 27, 1718.  Hans Hess appears to have stayed on this land track until 1726 as revealed by tax records.  He is on the tax record for the years 1719 to 1725.  He than moved to Conestoga Township, now Pequea, October 27, 1928.  Hans was naturalized in 1729.</p>
<p>  Hans built his first humble dwelling of tow-cloth, brought from Switzerland.  His second more substantial dwelling was built of hickory and bark so abundant in the new world's wilderness.  Hans built an altar of thanksgiving and worshipped God as his family increased as amicable Indian relations were established, and as the woods reduced for timber and tillage.</p>
<p>  By Oct. 17, 1728, Hans moved into Conestoga Township, now now Pequea near the present town of Bumgardner, Lancaster, Co., PA.  Hans probably sold his first 100 acre track to purchase the larger 195 acre Bumgardner (Bumgartner) tract for his growing family; deed records are not clear.  Has built a house northwest of the present town.  In the quietness of this wilderness he reared a noble family of eleven children, 4,500 miles from his own birthplace in Switzerland.  Hans willed his youngest son, Samuel, the 195 acres of this home farm farm.</p>
<p>  Hans and Magdalena were both buried on their Bumgardner tract along with some of their children.  The 1733 grave of Hans Hess is the third known marked grave in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The plot lies in a grove of trees on a hill south of Willow Street, Pennsylvania. An inventory 1733 states Hans was a shoemaker as well as a farmer.  He had a lingering illness.</p>
<p>  A good source for information on Hans, Magdalena and their children is "Community and material Culture Among Lancaster Mennonites: Hans Hess from 1717 to 1733," Pennsylvania Mennonite Heritage, XII, 1 (January 1990) p. 2.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Irvin David Hess, in his Genealogy states:  "(late of Conestoga Twp.) was born about 1722 presumably in that part of Chester Co. Pa. that was cut out and named Lancaster Co. in 1729.  He died in Conestoga Township, Lancaster Co. Pa. in 1794 as evidenced by his last will.  Since no wife nor children are mentioned in this will, it is presumed he never married.  He left a will which was very informative regarding family relationships. Among those named as beneficiaries is "Sister, Elizabeth, wife of Michael Kriter."  (Lancaster Co. Pa. Wills Record, Bk. "F" vol. 1, pgs 557-9)  Since the will and the associated deed contains considerable detail of the family, a reading of Irvin David Hess's summary is recommended.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>  Perhaps the families of Hans Egli Hess and Samuel Honegger Hess lived only in Germany from 1640 to 1680. Samuel came from Switzerland in 1712, but may have died back in Switzerland.</p>
