<blockquote><p>  THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE "AUSBUND"<br>
  In the year 1637 an aged man, John Jacob Hess was arrested.  This was the first time that the Governor sent officers to catch a person. He promised his peace with an escort.  Immediately after he was at the castle the Governor asked him how cautious he was since the meeting in the choir room,  and if he wanted to attend the State Church.  If you do not want to do this I will allow them to arrest you.  In three days five policemen were sent with weapons.  He was kept at Grueningen five days and from there he was taken to day court house in Zurich and kept 19 days in prison, but with the help of God he was release again.</p>
<p>  Thirty-four weeks later they went three policemen from Zurich who came to them at night, caught him, and took him to Othenbach jail where tow other brethren were held.  He spent eight weeks there, and then through an escape they were all free again.  In the year 1639 he was taken to Othenbach and imprisoned 83 weeks.</p>
<p>  This time they stripped him and placed him in irons for 16 weeks, after that he was free again.  They in 1639 they also caught his wife and let her to the court house where she was kept for several days after which she was taken to Othenbach where she was given limited food and drink and kept for 63 weeks.  With insufficient food and brutal treatment she finally passed away in bonds.</p>
