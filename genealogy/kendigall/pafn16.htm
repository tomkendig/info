<blockquote><p>[Kendig(Best).FTW]</p>
<p>(Best WS2) b. 1623; in 1634 aged 11, servant in Birmensdorf; in<br>
1637 serving in Birmensdorf with Jakob Bentz, miller;<br>
by 1657 emigrated to Eppingen, Germany; (? in 1685 a Mennonite<br>
living in Reihen, Germany).  m 1653, Eppingen,____.</p>
<p>Jacob Widmer (WS2), the eleven year-old son of Heini Widmer<br>
(WS) and Margareth Bentz, was recorded in 1634 in the<br>
census of Hedingen, southwest of the city of Zurich, as working<br>
in Birmensforf nearby with his sister Anna, aged fifteen.<br>
The 1637 census shows they worked at the mill for Jakob Bentz.<br>
The household included Hans Benz and his wife,<br>
Verena Meylin (ML41), niece of Hans Meylin (ML2), the<br>
Anabaptist minister.  Her brother Hans Heinrich Meili (ML42)<br>
was miller of Oberembrach and later of Basserdorf, and was<br>
married in 1634 to Barbara Dubendorfer.</p>
<p>The 1657 and 1663 lists of emigrants from Hedingen included<br>
three single sons of the deceased Heini Widmer,<br>
Jagli (Jakob), Kasper, and Uli Widmer, who had gone to Eppingen<br>
in the Kraichgau.  Jakob Widmer married there in<br>
1653, Uli in 1655, and Kasper in 1658</p>
<p>Because of his connections with the Anabaptist Meylin family,<br>
his age, and the places in which he lived, I (Best)<br>
believe this Jakob Widmer (WS2) was the Jakob Wittmer recorded<br>
as a Mennonite in Reihen in the Kraichgau in 1685,<br>
and probably the father of the John and Benjamin Witmer,<br>
Mennonites, who immigrated to present Lancaster County in 1717.<br>
John Witmer's daughter Barbara (WS211) married George Kendig,<br>
probably (?KA3521).  Uli Widmer (WS5) was probably the<br>
father of the Michael Witmer who immigrated in 1733, aged 65,<br>
on the "Hope" with sons Ulrich, Peter, and Hans.</p>
