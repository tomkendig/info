<blockquote><p>Henry Peoples dies at age of seventy-eight<br>
     Henry Peoples died at the home of a daughter, Mrs. Edward Kurtz, 1400 South Main Street, at 8:35 o'clock last night.  His death was caused by diabetes, which had afflicted him for months.  Until last November, for 16 years he had been night watchman for the Superior Ladder Company of Goshen.  At that time his health had failed to such an extent that he came to the home of his daughter in this city.<br>
     Mr. Peoples, who was born in Pennsylvania on August 21, 1840, went to a farm near New Paris in 1861, and from there to Goshen 29 years ago.  Mrs. Peoples died in Goshen.  Besides the daughter, Mrs. Kurtz, Mr. Peoples is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Edgar Stiver of Millersburg, and Mrs. Clara Trum of Ligonier:  a son,  Simon Peoples of Goshen; two brothers, W. E. Peoples of this city, and Alden Peoples of New Paris;  two sisters, Mrs. Sarah Juday and Mrs. Mathias Hire of New Paris, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.<br>
     The funeral services will be held in the Dunkard Church in Goshen at a time not yet determined.  The body will be placed in the receiving vault in Oakridge cemetery and later will be taken to New Paris for burial.<br>

<blockquote><p>     His son, John S. Juday, subject of this sketch, was born on a farm in Preble county, Ohio, January 20, 1831, and was brought to Indiana when a child of five years.  As a consequence nearly all his recollections are of Elkhart county, and he has known no other home.  He attended the old log school-house in the district, and while young killed many deer on the land  now farmed by himself and neighbors.  When twenty-five years of age he married Miss Levina Finlye, daughter of Orrin Finley, who was a native Vermonter and who settled in La Salle county, Ill.  Two children were born to this union:  Cora M., who died at the age of two years, and James O.  John S. Juday worked in La Salle county, Ill., two years and then made a settlement in Elkhart county, Ind.  His wife died three years after marriage, and Mr. Juday's second marriage was to Miss Sarah A. Peoples, daughter of Francis and Mary Peoples.  Two children blessed this union: Salena A. and Minnie A.  Our subject bought his present farm in 1868 and settled on it in 1870.  It then consisted of forty acres and to this he has since added eighty acres and now has 120 acres of good farming land.  He has a good brick residence, substantial barn, and everything about the place indicated a progressive and prosperous owner.  He is a public-spirited man, had taken an active interest in having good schools in his community, and is a member of the school board.  His children are all well educated.  His son, James O., is a farmer in La Salle county, Ill.  He is married and has two children.<br>

<p>Obit of Francis Peoples  18 Apr 1891<br>
     Francis Peoples, one of the old settlers of this county, died in Jackson Township, Elkhart County, April 17, 1891, age 77 years, 4 months, and 8 days.  He was born in Lancaster County, PA., Dec. 9, 1813, and was married to Miss Mary Kindig, of Montgomery County, Ohio.  Seven children were born to them, four sons and three daughters, one of whom a daughter, preceded the father across the river; the rest, with the aged companion surviving to mourn their loss.<br>
     The funeral services were held at the Baintertown church on Sunday afternoon.  There were 122 teams at the funeral.<br>
     Thus one by one our old settlers bid adieu to scenes of life and labor, and go where there are no more toil and tears, no night of death.<br>
     The chair that held his feeble frame<br>
     The dreaded winter through,<br>
     Is vacant now, there's no one here<br>
     To fill his place, 'tis true<br>
                    Mrs. Edna Peoples</p>
<p>     His son Francis, father of Mrs. Juday, was born in Lancaster county., Penn., December 9, 1813. and like most of his ancestors before him was a farmer.  He went to Ohio when a young man, or in 1835, and married Miss Mary Kindig, who was also a native of Lancaster county, Penn., born March 11, 1816, and the daughter of Henry and Madaline (Leslie) Kindig, both of whom were originally from Lancaster county, Penn., but early settlers of Montgomery county, Ohio.  To Mr. And Mrs. Peoples were born seven children:  Henry, Sarah A., Selina (died in infancy), William E., John F., Ann M. and Aldia A., all natives of Montgomery county, Ohio.  In 1859 Mr. Peoples came to Indiana and settled on the farm where his widow now resided.   There his death occurred April 17, 1891.  He was a worthy and honored citizen.  Both Mr. And Mrs. Peoples were baptized in the German Baptist Church August 17, 1862.  Mrs. Peoples is still living and is quite advanced in years.<br>
