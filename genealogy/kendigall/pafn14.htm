Pennslyvania from William Penn. Sailed from Gravesend, England in April 29,<br>
1710. Landed in Philadelphia, in Sept 1710. Name of the ship : Mary Hope,<br>
Mastered by John Annis.</p>
<p>Bishop Hans Herr:</p>

ends and parted in the middle, ...heavy brows, dark hazel eyes, aqualine nose,<br>
small mouth with heavy lips, complexion florid, with full beard covering face,<br>
the whole lighted by a countenancein wich sweetness and austerity were<br>
gracefully blended. Clad in coursest homespun, his feet shod with wood, he at<br>

people would be prosperous and happy, however poor when arriving.</p>
