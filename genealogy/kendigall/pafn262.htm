<blockquote><p>  Operated the mill built by the Hess family in 1792 along the Pequea Creek, Salisburg Township.  Christian, an ordained minister, before 1800, was the leading minister at Pequea Creek for many years before the first meeting/schoolhouse was erected.  Christian Hess, Jr., also a miller was elected trustee of the newly-built meeting/school house that was built on the<br>
opposite bank of the Pequea Creek north of the mill and given the Hess name.</p>
<p>Christian Hess, Sr. Margaret Hess, and Peter Eby moved to Salisburg Twp. from Warwick<br>
Twp. about 1792.  In 1879 when the second new meeting house was built, the congregation name changed from Hess to Hershey since the Hess families declined in the community and congregation.</p>
