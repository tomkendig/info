<blockquote><p>Ann attended the 2002 Kendig Gathering with Paul W. Rhoads and toured the Kendig Estate<br>
tour in Willow Street. Ann was quite talkative at the event and David Jay Kendig recorded some<br>
of her stories on video at the time. During the tour Ann did not reviel her age but did recall her<br>
trips as a young and small girl to the Kendig house where she had played in the elevator/dolly<br>
that went between floors of the three story house.</p>
