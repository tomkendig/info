<blockquote><p>Francis N. McNutt - Father's name not known.  She was illegitimate.  She received money from a trust fund for several years.  Her son Farrell (1916) also had a trust fund but her other son Thurl (1925) did not.  This leads me to believe that her father probably died between 1916 and 1925.<br>
Family rumors say he was from Chicago, IL.  Social Security number 313-01-3570D</p>
