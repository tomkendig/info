<blockquote><p>  Born in Europe, he came to America with his parents sometime about 1712 or later. Settled one mile east of Lititz, Warwick Twp, Lancaster, Co., PA 1735 on a 200 acre tract deeded to him from William Penn Jr. Sept. 25, 1735.  According to Clarke Hess, Hans, Jacob's father, had made initial payments before his death.  These 200 acres were farmed and owned by Jacob and his descendants 1735 to 1922. Jacob's original house no longer stands; however, a log house built c.1744-1761 stands and was probably built by Christian (3 generation) and John (3 generation).  A stone house also on the 200 tract, built c.1778 by John and Susanna Landis Hess (generation 3) stands some yards northwest of the log house. Woolrick Hoover (Huber) came to Warwick Twp. with Jacob and farmed an adjoining 290 acres. Both were Anabaptist.  Jacob was a deacon.</p>
<p>  A March 15, 1742 account and inventory upon Jacob's death, filed at Lancaster Historical Society, listed items as: shoemaker tools, smith bellows, pewter and farm equipment ..."cash in his wife's hands that was collected for the  poor" (probably because Jacob was a deacon). Dr. Sowers was Jacob's physician.  Jacob (generation 2) and John (generation 3) had no will as did their father, Hans ---probably due to early and unexpected deaths.  According to English law, with no will, the eldest son received the home farm and double portion.</p>
<p>  Both Jacob and Veronica are buried at the old log homestead cemetery in the 200-acre tract.  Twenty-five burial stones of second to fifth generation remained in 1985.</p>
<p>  Although Hans, Jacob's father, made no payments on the land purchased in Warwick Township, Jacob did in 1734 and 1735.  He was required to pay a total of 43.pounds, two shillings, including interest, after which the land was patented to Jacob on September 24, 1735.</p>
