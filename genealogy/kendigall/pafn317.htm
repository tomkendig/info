<p><a href="pafg317.htm#10439" name="10439"><b>Jacob Stauffer</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  He was the first to come to America of the Ibersheim families.</p>
<p>  Immigrant: At age twenty, he arrived in Philadelphia. on "Pink Plaisance" on Sept. 21, 1732 with brother Daniel.  He first went to the Mennonite settlement on Pequea Creek, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  Jacob warranted 300 acres of land in Warwick Township next to John Brubacher, 3 Apr. 1738, which he patented 5 Jun 1746.  A miller by trade, he owned and operated a grist and saw mill, located on the Hammer Creek, about four miles north of Lititz, Pennsylvania. In 1763, he turned it over to his son Christian.  Christian operated the mill for almost forth-five years.  Today the Stauffer Mill is known as Zartman's Mill.  Note: One source gives his dates as 1714-1775. In 1756 he bought land in Warwick as tenants in common with his nephew John Stauffer (1734-1799).  He was taxed in Warwick up until about 1768.  He was taxed at Donegal from 1769 to 1775., the year he died.  He was also taxed on 250 acres at Mount. Joy in 1770.</p>
<p>(Deed recorded Lancaster Co. PA. Bk. "I"  Vol 3, pgs. 49-59)  Each child received 42 pounds from Estate Settlement)  There were eleven children, but the 10th and 11th heirs are not named.</p>

<p><a href="pafg317.htm#10346" name="10346"><b>Magdalena Hess</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  Married Jacob Stauffer, c1710-1775, Warwick & Donegal Townships. 11 children.  One source gives her dates as March 28, 1717 - 1784.  The Stauffer Family History (p. 16) states that Jacob and Magdalena had 15 children, but then lists 16 names. I have listed 15 in this genealogy. The Egle notes list the husband of Magdalena as HENRY Stauffer, m. 1954, thus adding a note of uncertainty.</p>
