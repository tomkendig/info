&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt;Uncle Les was the funniest of all, some people say he was most like Grandma.<br>
He kept us all in stitches all the time, especially during church, when he would<br>
loudly whisper the silliest stuff and get us all in trouble. He survived incredible<br>
battles in WWII (including the Battle of the Bulge) and won several Purple<br>
Hearts, which he never told his kids (4 daughters) about until they found them in<br>
the attic a few years ago. (That was a mistake I made in the last email: it wasn't<br>
Earl who was in the service with Bumps, Russ, and Leroy, but Les. Uncle Earl<br>
wasn't in the service.) His daughters are all like him, very fun-loving, loving<br>
parents. I miss him very much. It's hard to figure what the deal is with Aunt<br>
Christine's saying she didn't know. I mean, she used to come to Grandma and<br>
Grandpa's on Sundays, and she's in all these photos. These days, she is my<br>
mom's favorite sister-in-law. It may have been the point at which you asked her. I<br>
know she felt that the siblings should have visited Uncle Earl more at the end.<br>
And I do too. I think watching each other get sick and die has been devastating<br>
on the living ones and that several of them (including my father) are in denial. My<br>
mom is the same way, barely visits her sister in the nursing home. My sister and<br>
I try to visit as many aunts and uncles as possible when we get home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
