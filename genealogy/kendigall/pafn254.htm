<p><a href="pafg254.htm#6953" name="6953"><b>Hans Hess</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  Some doubt has been expressed as to whether Hans was a direct ancestor to<br>
Jakob Kuntz Hess of the third generation who was arrested for his Anabaptist<br>
faith.</p>
<p>  The Hesses of old Zurich, were very noble families, who changed the spelling of their name several. times.  It was originally von Fergenu, von Schmid, and finally HESS. --- "The name "HESS" comes from the old German given name used before the use of the family names came into practice.  The name "HESSO" in German appeared as early as the 8th century. These names were used in all parts of Germany and among the German speaking people of Europe.  The family name "HESS" is found in many parts of Germany today without being connected or related to one another."</p>

<p><a href="pafg254.htm#6994" name="6994"><b>Michael Hess</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>  Youngest Hess child on boat to America. Settled on land south of New Danville, now owned by Henry Herr.  Bought land from Abraham and Anna Kaigee, who had purchased the land from Thomas and Richard Penn.  The deed was signed in 1754.  The price was 277 pounds, 17 shillinge, and 2 pence for the 115 acres. Now, 226 years later, the farm is still in the Hess family. (A HISTORY OF THE HESS FAMILY by Mrs. John Hess Hoffman)  One source states that he was born between 12 and 22 April, 1715 and that he died in 1760.</p>

<p><a href="pafg254.htm#7000" name="7000"><b>Barbara Kryter</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p><br>
  There is uncertainty concerning the family name of Barbara.  Her husband at some point made reference to his brother-in-law with the name Kryter (Kreider), and genealogists have assumed that the reference was to his wife's brother.  Others think that it may have been a reference to Michael's sister's husband.  A "K" has been placed in the names of their children in order to distinguish them from other Hesses in the index.</p>
