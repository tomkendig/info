Of the Kendig Family so far as can be learned at the present time, September
22, 1909</h1></center>
On account of violent persecution because of their religious convictions
a colony of Mennonites who, from all I can learn, fled from the Palatineates
to Berne, Switzerland, but finding persecution intolerable there returned
to the Palatinates, and under their Preacher, Hans Herr, sent out to Pennsylvania
about twelve of their prominent members, including Herr, to select a home
for them. They came to Lancaster County (i.e. Chester at that time) and
patented 10,000 acres of land in Pequea and Beaver valley. Among the pioneers
were Hans Herr, Martin Kendig, Hans Mylin and his two sons, John R. Bundely,
Jacob Miller, Wendell Bowman, and others. After securing the land, Kendig
returned to Germany and brought in the families, about twenty in number.
They increased in a few years to about thirty, but most of the later additions
were poor and the colonists were obliged to pay their passage. The 10,000
acres were distributed amongst the colonists, from 150 to 600 acres, proportioned
to their ability to pay, and are recorded in the Patent Office in Philadelphia.
<p>In addition to this, however, Martin Kendig, who was wealthy and evidently
a business man, patented large tracts in his own name, many of which he
subsequently conveyed to other parties. In Warrent Book 1700, 1714, page
229, Sept. 17, 1710, are three patents, 1060 A., 530 A., and 265 Acres.
It is evident to me that Martin Kendig, his oldest son, took his own share
in the allotment of the 10,000 acres, Martin providing for his younger
son, Jacob, from his own patented land at his death.
<p>About sixty years have passed since Mr. Theodore Herr and Milton B.
Eshleman planned to trace out the genealogy of the Herr and Kendig families
and their intermarriages. They originally designed to include the two families
because Hans Herr was married to Elizabeth Kendig, a sister of Martin Kendig,
but after including the Kendigs down to my father the magnitude of the
undertaking dawned upon them. Eshleman dropped out and moved to Perry County,
Pa., but Mr. Herr continued to work on the Herr family and their intermarriages,
and only included the Kendigs as they intermarried with the Herrs. He has
in these years produced a work containing over 18,000 names of Herr descendants
and families, which is a monument of perseverance and patient research
that should be in the hans of all who are interested in the early history
of the County and its inhabitants. Mr. Herr has kindly allowed me the privilege
of copying from his work many of the Kendig marriages with the Herr and
other families. Sixty years ago when Herr and Eshleman entered upon the
work they had advantages and facilities that no longer exist. Many aged
people have passed away who were intimate with persons who knew and associated
with the Kendigs, and many of the names who could trace up the family records
have died, and the Kendig burying ground on the original Martin Kendig
farm near West Willow, said to have contained fifteen or twenty headstones,
they had access to. This burying ground was cut through when the Quarryville
railroad was built. The stones, many of them broken, were cast into the
dump or bank, no doubt the skeletons also. I presume the Pennsylvania Railroad
would allow the privilege to dig them out. The farm passed from the Kendigs
to Mylins, and from them to Emanuel Harnish. His sons dwell there at the
present time.
<p>I will now copy the Herr and Eshleman tablet, premising by saying that
the name in German is Kuendig, Kundig, or Kundlich. As there is no letter
in the English alphabet to give the sound of the German "U" and "G", in
anglicising the name each one spelled to suit themselves. Of the three
brothers, one spelled "Kindig", another "Kendrick", and the third "Kendig".
As far as I can I have traced up everything. I can find only this one family
of Kendigs who came over with the Mennonites. No doubt there were others
in other sections, but I cannot find any Kendig who immigrated to Lancaster
County up to 1810, except that family six brothers and their families,
and one sister Married to Hans Herr. I do not even know if all of them
were married, and cannot know but some moved elsewhere.
<p>I will now give the family record, as follows:
<p>=/ sign = married.
<p>John Jacob Kendig (born about 1620 =/ Jane Mylin about 1640, Berne,
Switzerland.
<br>sons: Jacob, John, George, Martin, Henry, William
<br>Daughter: Elizabeth Kendig (1639 - 1730) =/ Hans Herr about 1660
<br>Children: 5 sons, 1 daughter.
<p>Frederick Kendig, brother of John Jacab Kendig (1608 - 1672) =/ Maria
Herr (1611-1677), a sister of Hans Herr, in 1636.

I went to see David Huber, a hale and hearty old man at eighty-seven. He
told me that when he was a young man his grandmother, who died aged ninety-two
years and who was acquainted and knew many of the Kendigs, that many of
the colonists were poor, but that the Kendig family were both rich and
influential and owned nearly all the land about Willow Street. Another
old man told me when I was a boy that in my grandfather's time he saw a
patent of Nobility; that may or may not be true, but Hans Herr has a coat
of arms and a patent of nobility dating back to 1099, recorded at Washington,
and the Nobility nearly always married in their own class. There should
be very little expense and no trouble to trace the Kendig family back from
John Jacob Kendig, either in Berne, Switzerland, or the Palatinates, probably
Suabia. They keep a correct record in Europe of all their subjects for
purposes of taxation and military service.
<p>In securing the names and dates I have read up for histories of Lancaster
County, examined the Register's and Recorder's offices in Chester and Lancaster
Counties; run over the list of inhabitants of Lancaster County to date
given; investigated a great many old burial grounds (which are generally
unsatisfactory, so many are not marked at all or effaced by time). I have
thus copied all I have from past records and cannot verify any part, beyond
my grandfather and his wife, and from that down to the present time.
