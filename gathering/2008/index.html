Planning continues for a Kendig gathering for the 300th anniversary of
Martin
Kendig's arrival in North America. This Kendig gathering would be in
2010
in Lancaster Pennsylvania.</h2>
<h2>
In preparation for this gathering, some Kendigs are considering bi
annual
Kendig gatherings on even years (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008) also in
Lancaster Pennsylvania. If you find it convenient, the odd years work
well
for reunions among smaller Kendig branches.</h2>
