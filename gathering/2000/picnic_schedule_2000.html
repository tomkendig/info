<h2>
Kendig reunion format</h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
Sunday the 23 of July 2000</h2></center>
The Kendig reunion will be a covered dish picnic at the East Lampeter park
for Kendigs, their families, their relatives and friends. A roast pig should
be ready for serving at about 12:30 PM. Drinks, paper needs and plastic
ware will be provided under the park pavilion. The park does have a no
alcohol provision. Electric outlets will be active for plugging in electric
food heaters or appliances. So bring a covered dish, reacquaint with relatives
you have not seen in years, see some Kendig's you have never meet before
and let the kids play.

<h2>
Kendig reunion location and lodging</h2></center>
East Lampeter Community Park is located on Hobson Rd just off Witmer Rd
near the town of Smoketown east of Lancaster City. Witmer Road runs between
Route 30 and Route 340. This location is not far from the Dutch Wonderland
Amusement Park. Out of town people are welcome to make arrangements to
stay at the Kendig Tourist Home in beautiful downtown Ronks - phone 717.393-5358.
Another alternative - more commercial - is the Bird-In-Hand Family Inn
who has a web page at "<a href="http://www.bird-in-hand.com">www.bird-in-hand.com</a>".
