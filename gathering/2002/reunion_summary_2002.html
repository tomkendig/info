Summary of 2002 Kendig tour and gathering</h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
3rd and 4th of August 2002</h2></center>
Although attendance was medium (87 people at the gathering), I believe
all that attended believed the weekend to be a success by several measures.
The Saturday tour of the John and Mary Kendig estate in Willow Street went
very well. Joanne Kendig Meyers now owns her Great Great Grandfather's
farm - she on the pioneer Martin Kendig branch. On Sunday a surprise attendance
from a group of Kendigs from Rochester NY (Gwen Kendig) resulted in tracing
back to the Henry Kendig branch, grandson of pioneer Martin Kendig.
<p>Saturday's genealogy share at the United Methodist Church in Strasburg
started events. The eight people who attended brought photos and reference
articles to share. It was during these exchanged that Joanne Kendig Meyers
was able to confirm where Isaac Kendig fit into the big genealogy picture.
Bill Kendig learned what choices he had to make if he decided to computerize
his genealogy records. James Willis Kendig gathered some information for
his upcoming article to be published in the Lancaster Mennonite Heritage
magazine (his second).
<p>The John and Mary Kendig estate tour in Willow Street was attended by
about 15 people. Joanne Kendig guided the tour providing good background
information on the house. Ann R Kendig, wife of Paul W. Rhoads provided
colorful stories at the three story, five chimney, slate roof house. Ann
stories of eating bananas on the steps of the house as a young child and
of riding the dumbwaiter from the first floor to the third for fun added
a little more color to the tour. After stops at the New Danville Cemetery
(Adam Kendig grave) and Conestoga Cemetery (Danville Adam Kendig grandchild
Adam Kendig grave), Tom L. Kendig took the tour to the Conestoga Museum
- where he found a Kendig relative in the one of the vintage 1910 (Harnish?)
reunion pictures on the wall.
<p>Sunday's gathering had Aunt Toot's Lickty (daughter of Earl Kendig)
organization skills showing as everything came together food wise and activity
wise. The pork sandwiches were great and Uncle Ray Kendig fresh boiled
corn is tough to beat - an attraction in it's own right! Gwen Kendig's
arrival from Rochester New York was a highlight for all. Her two grandchildren
enjoyed the pi&ntilde;ata and newly found but distant relatives. Gwen brought
her mother and daughter along - four generations making a day trip from
Rochester. Bob Kendig's genealogy setup made is possible for Gwen to find
her roots. Tom L. Kendig's hundred year old books left everyone see pieces
of history. Joanne Hess Siegrist - an affiliate of the Lancaster Mennonite
Historical Society - brought photos and provides some guidance to our genealogy
effort. Bill Kendig from Greenville SC and his uncle John Fridy Kendig
of Lancaster gathered in a group from David Kusseth branch (John Gantt
Kendig, Bill's brother from Richmond VA attended two years prior). The
largest group was from Oscar Kendig's descendants (of which I am a member).
There were some surprises attendees which were more distant - in both out
of town distance and because they did not carry the Kendig last name. The
late Edwin Cook Jr's three children (Ed, Carol &amp; Cathy from SC, MA
&amp; CA) attended as did Don Mancuso and family, son of the late Joe Macuso
and Craig Butz and family - these from the late Earl Kendig's wife Mary
Mancuso's side of the family. My cousin Greg Kendig attend with his month
old son Jack (youngest person at the gathering). I had not seen my cousin
Greg in 20 years. The reunions are great ways for all to see and catch
up with relatives! But then you all knew that.
<p>Plans remain for a 2004 Kendig gathering. Details for the gathering
continue to be found at www.kendig.net. Keep in touch, talk it up and we'll
see you there!
