The Kendig gathering will be a covered dish picnic at the East Lampeter
park for Kendigs, their families, their relatives and friends. Marianne
Lichty (Aunt Toots for me) has arranged for a roast pig - should be ready
for serving at about 12:30 PM. Ray Kendig will again provide fresh cooked
Lancaster county corn. Drinks, paper needs and plastic ware will be provided
under the park pavilion. The park does have a no alcohol provision. Electric
outlets will be active for plugging in electric food heaters or appliances.
So bring a covered dish, reacquaint with relatives you have not seen in
years, see some Kendig's you have never meet before and let the kids play.
