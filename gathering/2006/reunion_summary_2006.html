  <h2>Summary of 2006 Kendig Gathering</h2>
  </center>
  <center>
  <h2>&nbsp; 9th of July 2006</h2>
  </center>
The gathering this year was more festive than previous years as it was
a combined reunion and celebration of Kenny and Toots (Kendig) Lichty's
50th
Wedding Anniversary. There were approximately 120 people in attendance
including 63 people with ties to the Kendig surname - the balance of
the
folks were in attendance to honor Kenny and Toot's Anniversary. <br>
  <br>
The weather was sunny and comfortably warm with temperatures in the mid
70s. Many brought their lawn chairs and sat in the shade of the large
trees around the pavilion at East Lampeter Community park off Hobson
Road just east of Lancaster.<br>
  <br>
The food this year was exceptional. The sandwiches and wraps and relish
trays were catered for the Anniversary. The drinks were also provided
by
Aunt Toots. Ray Kendig fired up the propane heated garbage can to steam
fresh corn - delicious. Most people brought covered dishes, excellent
covered dishes. Deviled eggs, red beet eggs,&nbsp; bean salad, cooked
beans. Desserts too made the event complete with Yum Yum, pecan pie,
shoe fly pie, apple pie, several fruit salads - a complete spread of
the
bounties of Lancaster County. Kenny and Toots children (Mike and Teri
and Tim) helped with much of the setup and tear down.<br>
  <br>
The person that traveled&nbsp; furthest would have been Tom Kendig from
California, 2840 miles. Second farthest would be Craig &amp; Mary Ellen
Butz from Rochester New York, 319 miles. Linda Lowry from Salisbury
Maryland, 162 miles also attended. The most distant in terms of
relation from Tom Kendig was a new attender,
Elizabeth Kendig who is from Pittsburgh PA and is attending Franklin
&amp; Marshall college in Lancaster. She and her cousin Alex stopped by
and
enjoyed the food and people. After some research we calculated she and
Tom Kendig are 5th cousins.
Other more distant relatives but not directly Kendigs attending
included Don and Bonnie Mancuso and Phyllis and Scott Drackley
whose parents Lillian and Stoney recently passed away. Local Mennonite
historian Joanne Hess Siegrist stopped by to report on her trip to
Switzerland and the upcoming reconciliation project in the town of
Emmental Switzerland called the <a
 href="http://www.emmental.ch/taeuferjahr07/">Taeuferjahr</a>.
It turns out Gene Lowry's wife Mary is good friends with
Joanne and it was through Mary that the lineage of Jane Evans Best may
be traced. Jane Evans Best is a publisher of one of the key Kendig
history articles in the Pennsylvania Mennonite Heritage Journal. <br>
  <br>
There were two antique autos that made for great photo opportunities.
Aunt Toots provided bubbles for the kids to play with. Jay Kendig
provided a TV so the World Cup final could be watched. Italy beat
France after a tied match of 1-1 went to kicks from the penalty mark.<br>
  <br>
This year there was little interest in the Genealogy share or Kendig
tour.
Maybe in two more years there will be more interest. Several of us did
go the following day to the beautiful residence of Mary and Gene Lowry
south of New Holland to visit and share how Mary does genealogy work.
Mary is kind of the secretary for the annual Rank reunion which has
fliers and mailing lists. Some of Mary's tips on how to record
historical documents are published on the <a
 href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Kendig/">Kendig</a>
yahoo group which focuses on Kendig genealogy.<br>
  <p>Plans remain for a 2008 Kendig gathering which will be held on the
second Sunday of July, the 13th. Details for the
gathering can be found at www.kendig.info and at the <a
 href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/KendigGathering/">KendigGathering</a>
yahoo group (which has some pictures recalling the event). Keep in
touch, talk
it up and
we'll see you there!<br>
